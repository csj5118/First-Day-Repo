    <section>
        <h1> This is still a test on the first day repo</h1>
        <p> This is a part of the work that I'd like to experiment and see different commands such as "p"</p>

        <p> in the next block or section i'd like to demonstrate the use of ul and li</p>
    </section>

    <section class="class">
        <ul>
            <li class="class"> here we are testing bullet #1</li>
            <li class="class"> here we are testing bullet #2</li>
            <p class="class"> good thing to note here is if i put a paragraph under a li it will be aligned</p>
        </ul>
        <p> however if i put it past the ul command then it should return alignment to the furthest left</p>
    </section>

    <!-- we have started implementing class="class" to this section and if we reference the style.css the class section will have different colors and background color 
    including the change in font style (times new roman)-->

    <section id="teach-all"> 
        <!-- now i want to try and add some type of contact information from what i can remember-->
        <!-- note that just using a href will just add a link to my email.-->
        <h2 id="teach-all"> Contact me here :</h2>
        <a href="testing a link" id="teach-all"> csh.joo77@gmail.com</a>
        <!-- adding it with the same line as p and ending the full code with p will now add text into a link.-->
        <p id="teach-all"> Contact me through Email : <a href="test" id="teach-all"> csh.joo77@gmail.com</a></p>
        <p id="teach-all"> <strong> My phone number :</strong> <a href="test" id="teach-all"> csh.joo77@gmail.com</a></p>
    </section>

    <!-- since we link the html to the css sheet id like to experiment-->
    <!-- setting specific id selectors to each of the code will allow the page and bottom of contact information to appear white text with blue background color-->
